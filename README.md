## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my hands-on experience with **Active Directory (AD)** by building a lab environment on **Microsoft Azure VMs**.  
It covers the setup of domain services, users, groups, and applying **Group Policies (GPOs)**.  

The lab simulates a small corporate environment, allowing testing of AD concepts in a safe, isolated environment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Azure Cloud** – Virtual Machines, Networking  
- **Windows Server** – Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)  
- **Active Directory** – Users, Groups, Organizational Units (OUs), GPOs  
- **DNS & DHCP** – Basic network services  
- **PowerShell** – Automation & AD configuration scripts

## 🔧 Lab Setup
1. Created **Azure Virtual Network** and subnets for lab environment.  
2. Deployed **Windows Server VMs** for Domain Controller and client machines.  
3. Installed and configured **Active Directory Domain Services**.  
4. Created **Users, Groups, and OUs** to simulate company structure.  
5. Applied **Group Policies** for security and login management.  
6. Tested **client machines joining the domain** and GPO application.
